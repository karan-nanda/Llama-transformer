# LLaMA: Text Completion with Transformer Models

LLaMA is an advanced text completion system developed using Transformer-based models for natural language processing tasks. This project leverages PyTorch for deep learning model architecture, including self-attention mechanisms and feed-forward networks, to provide accurate and contextually relevant text completions.

## Project Overview

The LLaMA project focuses on the following key components:

- Utilizing PyTorch for deep learning model architecture design and training.
- Implementing SentencePiece for tokenization and preprocessing of text data.
- Incorporating top-p (nucleus) sampling techniques for enhanced diversity in text generation.
- Managing batch processing, EOS (end-of-sequence) token handling, and model inference on CPU/GPU environments.

## Features

- Text Completion: Generate contextually relevant text completions given input prompts.
- Transformer Models: Utilize Transformer-based architectures for robust natural language understanding and generation.
- Batch Processing: Efficiently process multiple input prompts using batch processing techniques.
- Top-p Sampling: Enhance text generation diversity through top-p sampling techniques.
- EOS Token Handling: Properly handle end-of-sequence tokens for text completion sequences.
